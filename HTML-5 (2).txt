Q-4 Canvas and SVG tags

=>The <canvas> tag in HTML is used to create dynamic, bitmap-based graphics using JavaScript.It provides a drawing surface that can be manipulated through scripting to create charts, animations, and interactive content. On the other hand, the <svg> tag is used to define vector-based graphics using XML. SVG allows for scalable and resolution-independent graphics, making it suitable for creating logos, icons, and illustrations. Both tags enable rich visual content on web pages, but <canvas> is pixel-based and suitable for complex animations, while <svg> is resolution-independent and better for static graphics with crisp edges.
